## ⚡ Performance-Conscious Improvements

### What NOT to Add (Performance Risks)
❌ Real-time WebSockets (adds connection overhead)
❌ Heavy chart libraries (Chart.js, Recharts - large bundle size)
❌ Complex state management (Redux - unnecessary complexity)
❌ Video streaming (bandwidth intensive)
❌ Social media embeds (slow third-party scripts)
❌ Heavy animations (Framer Motion - large bundle)

### What TO Add (Performance-Safe)
✅ Client-side filtering (no server load)
✅ Simple CSS animations (no JS libraries)
✅ Native browser APIs (clipboard, print)
✅ Lazy loading images (Next.js Image component - already available)
✅ Static generation where possible (Next.js already does this)
✅ Minimal dependencies (use native features)

### Database Optimizations (If Needed)
1. **Add indexes** on frequently queried columns (if queries are slow)
2. **Limit query results** (pagination if tables get very long)
3. **Cache static data** (tournament info that doesn't change often)

## 📱 Mobile-Specific (Lightweight)

1. **Touch-friendly buttons** - Ensure buttons are large enough (48px min)
2. **Better mobile table view** - Already have card view, ensure it's used
3. **Swipe gestures** - Optional, only if users request it
4. **Viewport meta tag** - Ensure it's set correctly (likely already done)

**Note:** Your site is already responsive - these are just polish items.

## 🎨 Design Polish (No Performance Impact)

1. **Consistent spacing** - Use Tailwind spacing scale consistently
2. **Hover states** - Add subtle hover effects (CSS only)
3. **Focus states** - Better keyboard navigation indicators
4. **Loading skeletons** - Already mentioned, but important
5. **Success feedback** - Toast notifications (react-hot-toast already installed)

**Note:** All CSS-only improvements - zero performance impact.

## 🚀 Recommended Implementation Order
